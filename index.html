            <p class="text-green-700 leading-relaxed">
                Informally, the field of animal breeding began when domestication of animals was initiated by humans. During this period, the key criteria for choosing species of animals to domesticate included traits related to temperament (docility of the animals), ability to produce foods which are basically milk, meat, and fibre; and reproductive performance of the animals when they were in captivity. Animals that did not reproduce, were not relatively docile, and of course cannot produce products that humans needed to survive themselves as a result such animals were culled.
            </p>
            <p class="text-green-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                The informal process of animal breeding described above which was basically domestication was stepped up formally by Robert Bakewell who introduce the process of breeding whereby animals that has traits of producing human foods from his stock were used to cross animals of other people. This was built upon with other developments including present breeding activities involving modern-day animal breeding practices such as highly sophisticated statistical models, use of powerful computational resources, and economic modelling all developed and supported by global community of public and privately supported scientists from across disciplines.
